# 309 | Discord Username Checker

This is a specialized tool written in Python to search for *available usernames on Discord*. It allows you to **multi-thread** through lists and check words for validity. Useful for those looking for a suitable username — or collecting them!

> 🧠 This is my first full-scale project on GitHub. I would be very glad if you rate the project and give it a ⭐!

---

## ⚠️ Attention

For the tool to work properly, it is recommended to use several Discord accounts, aka *discord tokens*. It is based on checking usernames' availability in real Discord sessions to **avoid rate limits** (for now).

---

## 🚀 Main Features

- ✅ **Token validation** — removes invalid tokens from sessions.
- ⚡ **Multithreaded checking** of usernames' availability using tokens.
- 🛠 **Lots of customizable options** and parameters.

## 🔥 Usage

To use all the features, you'll need a few Discord accounts and their tokens.\
Here's a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnBnm_tZlyU) on how to get them.

Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mentaldefeat/309.git
cd 309
```

Or download it manually as a ZIP.

### 2. Add your tokens

Create or edit the `tokens.txt` file and insert your tokens.

### 3. Install dependencies & run

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

✅ The tool is now running and ready to check usernames!

## 🔮 Async support and powerful improvements soon!

I continue to improve this project and explore **new, more efficient methods** of checking usernames.\
I'm almost done with one **OP tokenless strategy** 👀
